## Design Consistency

All fixed pages follow the aesthetic theme:
- Clean white cards with subtle shadows
- Natural green color scheme (#2d6a4f primary)
- Inter font for body text
- Playfair Display for headings
- Consistent spacing and border radius
- Fully responsive layouts

## Next Steps

The following templates still need aesthetic updates (noted in CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md):
- social/create_story.html
- social/friends_list.html
- social/find_friends.html
- social/marketplace.html
- social/memories.html
- social/professional_profile.html

These pages exist but use old styling and should be updated when needed.
