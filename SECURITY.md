## Database Credentials Exposure - RESOLVED

**Issue:** PostgreSQL database credentials were accidentally exposed in the repository.

**Date:** October 20, 2025

**Status:** âœ… RESOLVED

### Actions Taken:

1. **Removed exposed credentials** from all files
2. **Added .env.production to .gitignore** 
3. **Created .env.production.template** with safe examples
4. **Updated settings.py** to use environment variables only
5. **Committed security fixes** to remove sensitive data

### Recommendations:

1. **Change database password immediately** if this was a real production database
2. **Rotate all API keys and secrets** that may have been exposed
3. **Use environment variables** for all sensitive configuration
4. **Never commit .env files** to version control

### Safe Configuration:

- Use `.env.production.template` as a reference
- Copy to `.env.production` and fill with real values
- The `.env.production` file is now ignored by git

**Note:** This repository now follows security best practices for credential management.
